Introduction to Biometrics - Dealing with scores


The following performance characteristics are computed from a given
score matrix:
* Genuine and Impostor Frequency Diagram
* False match rate (FMR) as a function of decision threshold
* False non-match rate (FNMR) a function of decision threshold
* Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (sometimes the term "DET" (Detection Error Tradeoff) is used)
* The equal error rate (EER) from a ROC curve 
* 1-FNMR against FMR
